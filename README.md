# Homework1-Code-Refact

## Description

This project consists of making the site more accessible in order to be better optimized for search engines. Based on the above, this will allow people with disabilities to have a detailed understanding of the parts that make up the page.

The title was changed to "Horiseon Home Page" to make it more descriptive of what the page refers to. 

A semantic criterion was used in the HTML code to define the main and secondary parts. In addition, this allows the user to identify headings, articles, images and lists. The main links on the page were corrected to be guided to the appropriate section. Alt attributes were used to describe the images and make them more accessible to people with disabilities.

In the CSS code a semantic criterion was also used and the classes were adjusted to be functional with the new structure. Adjusted the CSS code to condense the classes and selectors where they could be used for various parts in the HTML file.

## Acceptance Criteria

```

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
